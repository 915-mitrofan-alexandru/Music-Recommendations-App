<h3>Thesis - User and Item Based Music Recommender Systems for Flutter Mobile Applications Using Spotify Audio Features</h3>

## ðŸ“– About

This application is built on Flutter, with Cloud Functions for the server side, and uses two recommender system algorithms in order to suggest music to the users on the platform. The user based algorithm uses the friends of the user in order to suggest similar music they might like. The item based algorithm uses Spotify audio features to calculate the similarity between songs and generate recommendations to the user.

## Functionalities

* **Signing up by connecting the account to Spotify** - by providing information
such as name or email and a password.
* **Logging into the account** - by connecting to the Spotify account.
* **Deleting the account** - available only while the user is logged in.
* **Choosing preferred genres** - when logging in for the first time, the user will
be asked to give a few favourite genres so that recommendations can be done
based off of them.
* **Adding and removing friends** - Once logged in, the user has the possibility to
search for other users by their ID and send a friend request.
* **Approving and denying friend requests**.
* **Seeing their profile** - where all the friends and friend requests are shown, profile information such as name, ID, and profile picture are shown and also the
currently playing song is shown.
* **Rate the currently playing song** - As stated previously, the app tracks the current song the user is playing on Spotify. They will have the option to rate the
song from 1-5. The list with rated songs should be accessible in a different
section;
* **Access to the Recommendation Section** - in this section, song recommendations are shown based on the music the user has listened to and songs their
friends have listened to and rated well, as well as by their chosen genres or by
the time of day (if morning, more energising songs will be recommended).
